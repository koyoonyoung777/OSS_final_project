 What does this project do? -> 
  This program is called 'Watermelon Game'. This game combines two small circles to make a bigger circle. When a large circle is made, the score goes up, and the final goal is to increase the score more. I wanted to take the source of this game and add other elements to make it my own game.ðŸ˜Š
