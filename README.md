 # Project name
 Reverse Watermelon game
 
 # What does this project do?
  This program is called 'Watermelon Game'. This game combines two small circles to make a bigger circle. 
  When a large circle is made, the score goes up, and the final goal is to increase the score more. 
  I wanted to take the source of this game and add other elements to make it my own game. 
  What I wanted to do was create a difficult version of this game. So I changed this game the other way around.
